Go to Configuration, DVB Inputs and TV Adapters. Verify that your TV Tuner cards are being detected. I have had a lot of luck with the tuner cards I have thrown at TVHeadend. If you stick with the Avermedia/ Leadtek brands you should be okay.

Now that we have verified that the tuner is working we need to setup the scanning range to tell the tuner what frequency to scan in. The next couple of steps are very similar to setting up a new tv. Click on Networks beside TV Adapters.

Select Add, Click on the drop down arrow and select DVB-T Network.

In the Add DVB-T Network, enter the following and select Create:

Go back to the TV Adapters tab and select the tv adapter. On the right hand side select the drop down on Networks and select Croatia and Enable the adapter. Click on save.
Now that we have added a way for the TV tuner to scan channels, lets scan some channels. Go back into the Networks tab and select the Croatia network, and select Force Scan.

Once everything is finished up you should see something similar like the following:

We now need to add them finally to TVHeadend. Click on Map Services and Map all services.

Click on Map services.

We now need to test a couple of channels to ensure that everything is working as it should. Click on the Play button on one of the channels and you should download a .m3u file.

Open it up with VLC and you should see live TV start to play. Ensure that the quality and sound is okay.
